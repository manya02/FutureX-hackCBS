<h1 align=center>Hey Everyone</h1><br>

Team FutureX is here with an amazing idea.<br>

Problem statement : Lack in expressing thoughts, incomprehension, thoughts are never useless: they have some meaning!<br>
We are building a system that will convert your story/speech into animated video.<br>
For example , suppose you are telling your friend about an incident. What if I told you that you can see the entire incident on a real time video?<br>

So, here is simple solution to this complex problem.<br>


Our targeted audience are children who can visualize their imagination and funny thoughts.<br>
We have divided our idea into four modules:<br>
<ul>
<li>
Speech Recognition
It will convert your audio into text.
</li>
<li>
Text Summarization
It will summarise your input texts.
</li>
<li>
Image formation
Images will generated from texts.
</li>
<li>
Video Formation
All images will combine and form a meaningful story.
</li>
